\begin{abstract}
This report describes ongoing work of verifying invertibility 
conditions for the theory of fixed-width bit-vectors, 
that are used 
to solve quantified bit-vector formulas in the 
Satisfiability Modulo Theories ($\smt$) solver $\cvcfour$. 
This work complements the verification 
efforts of previous work by proving a subset of these
invertibility conditions in the \coq proof assistant.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The theory of bit-vectors can be used to model problems 
in various applications such as hardware circuit analysis, 
bounded model checking, and symbolic execution. Most of 
these applications require reasoning about quantified 
formulas over bit-vectors. Few SMT solvers can deal 
with this fragment, one of which is \cvcfour. \cvcfour 
uses a quantifier 
instantiation technique to reason about quantified formulas. 
As presented in \cite{b1}, a quantifier instantiation 
method using invertibility conditions benefits from a smaller 
number of instantiations, resulting in a more efficient 
solver.An invertibility condition for a literal specifies 
the conditions under which that literal is solvable. For 
instance, $\equal{\bvadd{x}{s}}{t}$ is unconditionally solvable 
for $x$, where $x$, $s$, and $t$ are bit-vectors of the 
same sort and $\bvaddf$ is bit-vector addition. 
A general solution or inverse for $x$ is $\bvsub{t}{s}$, and 
since $x$ is always invertible, the invertibility condition 
for the literal $\equal{\bvadd{x}{s}}{t}$ is 
simply $\true$. This is represented by the equivalence 
$\equal{\bvadd{x}{s}}{t} \iff \true$. 
A more interesting case is that 
of bit-wise conjunction, which is represented by the 
equivalence 
$\equal{\bvand{x}{s}}{t} \iff \equal{\bvand{t}{s}}{t}$.
Reference \cite{b1} found 
160 of these invertibility equivalences for a 
representative set of operators and predicates from the 
bit-vector theory of the \smtlib standard 
(in the previous two examples, the operators are 
$\bvaddf$ and $\bvandf$, 
and the predicate is equality, or $\teq$) and verified them 
for bit-widths up to 65. The correctness of the quantifier 
instantiation technique that uses these equivalences,
however, assumes the equivalences to be valid in the 
theory of bit-vectors for any bit-width $n$.
The challenge of verifying these equivalences for 
bit-vectors of arbitrary bit-widths comes from 
SMT-solvers' inability to express bit-vectors over
arbitrary bit-widths. Reference \cite{b2} encoded 
these problems over the theory of non-linear arithmetic 
with uninterpreted functions. The corresponding verification 
efforts were still unable to prove over a quarter of the 
equivalences. We complement these works by proving a 
representative subset of invertibility equivalences in 
the \coq proof assistant. We extended a bit-vector 
library (\rem{cite SMTCoq}), and proved 18 invertibility equivalences.


\section{Preliminaries}
\label{prelim}
We assume the usual terminology of many-sorted 
first-order logic with equality
(see, e.g.,\rem{cite} for more details).  
We denote equality 
by $=$, and use $x\neq y$ as an abbreviation for $\neg(x=y)$.  
The signature $\sigbv$ of the \smtlib theory of fixed-width bit-vectors
includes a unique sort for each positive integer $n$,
which we denote by $\sortbv{n}$.  
For every positive integer $n$ and a bit-vector of
width $n$, the signature includes a constant of sort $\sortbv{n}$ 
in $\sigbv$ representing that
bit-vector, which we denote as a binary string of length $n$.
The function and predicate symbols of $\sigbv$ are as
described in the \smtlib standard.

Formulas of
$\sigbv$ are built from variables (sorted by the sorts $\sortbv{n}$),
bit-vector constants, and the function and predicate symbols of $\sigbv$,
along with the usual logical connectives and quantifiers.  
%We write
%$\psi[x_{1}\til x_{n}]$ to represent a formula whose free %variables are
%from $\{x_{1}\til x_{n}\}$. 

The semantics of $\sigbv$-formulas is given by interpretations that extend a
single many-sorted first-order structure so that the domain of every sort
$\sortbv{n}$ is the set of bit-vectors of bit-width $n$, and the function and
predicate symbols are interpreted as specified by the \smtlib standard.  A
$\sigbv$-formula is said to be \emph{valid} in the theory of fixed-width bit-vectors
if it evaluates to true in every such interpretation.

In what follows, we denote by $\coqsig$ the sub-signature of $\sigbv$
containing the predicate symbols 
$\bvultf$, $\bvugtf$, $\bvulef$, $\bvugef$ 
(corresponding to strong and weak unsigned comparisons
between bit-vectors, respectively), as
well as the function symbols $\bvaddf$ (bit-vector addition), $\bvandf$, $\bvorf$, $\bvnot$ (bit-wise conjunction,
disjunction and negation), 
$\bvnegf$ (2's complement unary negation), 
and $\bvshl$, $\bvlshrf$ and
$\bvashrf$ (left shift, and logical and 
arithmetical right shifts).  
%
We also
denote by $\cavsig$ the extension of $\coqsig$ with the predicate symbols
$\bvsltf$, $\bvsgtf$, $\bvslef$, and $\bvsgef$ 
(corresponding to strong and weak signed comparisons
between bit-vectors, respectively), as 
well as the function symbols $\bvsubf$,
$\bvmulf$, $\bvudivf$, $\bvuremf$ (corresponding to subtraction,
multiplication, division and remainder), 
and $\bvconcatf$ (concatenation).  
%We use $0$ to represent the bit-vectors composed of all $0$-bits.
%Its numerical or bit-vector interpretation should be clear from context.  
%Using bit-wise negation $\bvnotf$, we can express the bitvectors composed
%of all $1$-bits by $\bvnot{0}$.
 

\section{Invertibility Equivalence Proofs}
\label{ieproofs}
An invertibility condition for a variable $x$ in a $\sigbv$-literal $\ell[x,s,t]$ is
a formula $IC[s,t]$ such that
$\forall s.\,\forall t.\,IC[s,t] \Leftrightarrow \exists x.\ell[x,s,t]$ is valid in the theory of fixed-width bit-vectors.

Reference \cite{b1} define invertibility conditions for 
a representative set of literals $\ell$ having a single occurrence of $x$,
that involve the bit-vector operators of $\cavsig$.
The soundness of the technique proposed in that work 
relies on the correctness of the invertibility conditions.
Every literal $\ell[x,s,t]$ and its corresponding invertibility condition $IC[s,t]$
induce the \emph{invertibility equivalence}
\[
\forall s:\sortbv{n}.\,\forall t:\sortbv{n}.\,IC[s,t] \Leftrightarrow \exists x:\sortbv{n}.\ell[x,s,t] \ .
\]
which one needs to prove valid for \emph{all} $n >0$.
Reference \cite{b1} was able to prove these 
equivalences for values of $n$ from $1$ to $65$.

Reference \cite{b2} proves a over half of the 160 
equivalences for arbitrary bit-widths 
using \smt-solvers by encoding the equivalences 
into theories which the solvers could deal with.

We proved focused mainly on proving those equivalences 
that \cite{b2} failed to prove. We chose $\coqsig$ as a 
representative subset of $\cavsig$, and proved 18 of the 
equivalences, 11 of which were unproved by \cite{b2}. Our 
results are summarized in \Cref{icresults}.

\section{Library and Proof Details}
\label{proofs}
We used a library originally developed for the
\smtcoq tool \rem{cite} - a \coq plugin 
that dispatches proof goals to \smt-solvers.
Although there are other libraries such as 
\rem{cite Bedrock, SSRBit and the Coq library here},
we choose this library because it was developed 
for \smtlib bit-vectors, and as a result, had many 
relevant lemmas for our proofs already available.
We extended this library with the $\bvashrf$
operator, and the predicates $\bvulef$ and $\bvugef$.
In using the library for our proofs, we also enriched 
it with various additional lemmas.

The bit-vector library represents bit-vectors as 
lists of Booleans, dependent on a natural number, 
representing their size. This dependent bit-vector 
type is constructed from an underlying non-dependent 
representation. This separation makes it easier to 
expand the library - one can represent operators 
and lemmas in the non-dependent representation, 
before using the library's functor to transform it 
into the required dependent type. \rem{citations}

We were also assisted by CoqHammer



\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

%\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
